This is my final year project in The University of Hong Kong as a computer science student.

It is a web application that allows people to do real time video communication, just like zooming. The difference is that the video is replaced by an avatar.

# Demo
Thanks to a virtual machine server provided by HKUCS department, we are able to deploy the project with nginx.
