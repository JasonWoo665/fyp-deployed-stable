This is my final year project in The University of Hong Kong as a computer science student.

It is a web application that allows people to do real time video communication, just like zooming. The difference is that the video is replaced by an avatar.

## Current progress
 - Audio of avatar and customization of avatar settings are to be implemented
 - styles of pages need to be implemented
