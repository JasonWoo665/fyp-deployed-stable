This is my final year project in The University of Hong Kong as a computer science student.

It is a web application that allows people to do real time video communication, just like zooming. The difference is that the video is replaced by an avatar.

## Current progress
 - the function of changing avatars
 - the function of uploading custom backgrounds 
 - database saving the background images
 - styles of pages


## Future work
 - better eyeball tracking A.I
 - voice changer
